# Gradio Interface for Text Summarization and Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Gradio-based web application that performs both text summarization and sentiment analysis using the Hugging Face transformers library. The summarization is based on `facebook/bart-large-cnn`, and sentiment analysis is done using Hugging Faceâ€™s default sentiment analysis pipeline.

## Features

- Summarize long texts into concise summaries.
- Analyze the sentiment of the summarized text.
- Gradio interface for easy interaction.

## How It Works

1. **Summarization**: Enter any long piece of text, and the model will generate a summary.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: After summarizing, the sentiment of the summary is evaluated, producing a label (e.g., 'POSITIVE', 'NEGATIVE') and a sentiment score.
